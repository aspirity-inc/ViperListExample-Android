# ViperListExample-Android
ViperListExample is a small and simple application showing basics of [VIPER](https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/) architecture with dependency injection and reactive programming.
Cool article in russian about this stuff is [here](https://habrahabr.ru/company/rambler-co/blog/277003/).
The app contains two modules:
* List module loading and showing a collection of thumbnails
* Details module showing a full-size image

The app is based on an example shown [here](https://github.com/VictoriaSlmn/Android-VIPER).
